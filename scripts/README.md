# Repository tooling

Start with these commands from the repository root. They need only Python 3.10+
and the standard library:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev.py --help
python3 scripts/dev.py map
python3 scripts/dev.py map conversation
python3 scripts/dev.py doctor
python3 scripts/dev.py check
python3 scripts/check_architecture.py
```

`map` reads the current source tree, lists production packages, shows the ten
largest production source files, and counts the JVM and Android test source
sets. The optional query searches paths and package names. Source size is a
navigation aid; it is not an acceptance threshold.

`doctor` reports tool availability and SDK/signing configuration presence. It
never displays signing values, changes configuration, installs dependencies, or
fails simply because a local Android environment is unavailable. Tool presence
does not validate its version. See [the verification prerequisites](../docs/verification/README.md#local-checks-and-device-exploration)
for the pinned versions and disposable-emulator requirements.

`check` checks architecture dependencies, runs both Python helper suites, and
returns a failure from any of these checks. The hosted workflow's helper-test
step uses this same command. It resolves
the repository from its own file location, so an absolute
invocation also works from another directory. The two underlying commands are:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*.py'
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/verification -p 'test_*.py'
```

The second discovery is explicit because `scripts/verification` is a namespace
directory; ordinary discovery from `scripts` does not recurse into it. Python
checks cover helper logic and failure injection. They do not run JVM, native,
Android, acoustic or real-model tests and do not establish APK verification.
The build-751 retry regression uses a checked-in minimal synthetic fixture in
`verification/fixtures`, preserving the documented artifact-ID ordering without
depending on a previous developer's scratch directory. It is not CI evidence.

`check_architecture.py` guards the concrete composition and storage-admission
boundaries: feature implementations cannot reference `JarvisRuntime` or
`MainActivity`, and model code cannot read conversation implementation state.
The explicit entry-point allowlists retain the Android lifecycle and public UI
compatibility adapters. Comments/literal text are ignored while executable Kotlin
string interpolations are checked; this is a source
guard, not a Kotlin parser or a complete package dependency analysis. Code review
and compilation remain required. There are no file-length thresholds.

## Build inputs and native preparation

Gradle invokes these scripts as declared build inputs. Keep their existing paths
and command-line contracts stable; moving a helper also requires updating its
Gradle inputs and native cache keys.

| Helper | Responsibility | Main caller |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prepare_sherpa_sdk.py` | Extract the official pinned Sherpa Kotlin ABI (`classes.jar`). | `app/build.gradle.kts` |
| `build_sherpa.py` | Build the pinned Sherpa JNI/ORT runtime and apply the required JNI profile. | `app/build.gradle.kts` |
| `sherpa_jni_profile.py`, `sherpa_required_symbols.json` | Declare and validate the Sherpa JNI pruning/symbol contract. | `build_sherpa.py`, `check_asr_apk.py`, helper tests |
| `prepare_moonshine_sdk.py` | Extract Moonshine and namespace its version-specific ORT runtime while preserving ELF layout. | `app/build.gradle.kts` |
| `ci_gradle.sh` | Run the caller's Gradle tasks and retain non-secret build-performance diagnostics. | `.github/workflows/android.yml` |

Sherpa and Moonshine deliberately use different preparation paths. Moonshine's
ORT namespacing and Sherpa's source-built runtime preserve their distinct native
ABIs; they must not be replaced by a generic AAR extraction shortcut.

## Release validation and evidence

The [verification guide](../docs/verification/README.md) and
[feature acceptance map](../docs/verification/features.md) define the full
release contract. These helpers each validate a specific boundary:

| Helper | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `check_keyword_models.py` | Exercise both pinned keyword models with the actual compiled native interpreter. Requires the native test executable as its argument. |
| `check_asr_apk.py` | Validate APK native speech symbols and transitive packaged dependencies. |
| `check_tts_callback.py` | Validate the packaged TTS callback ABI. |
| `check_compact_apk.py` | Compare normal and compact APK contents against the existing variant contract. |
| `apk_size_report.py` | Produce APK component-size evidence and baseline comparisons. |
| `verification/android.py` | Execute named release journeys on a disposable emulator; retain commands, screenshots, UI XML, logs and results. |
| `verification/artifacts.py` | Select/download exact-run artifacts using producer-attempt timestamps, revision binding and archive checks. |
| `verification/receipt.py` | Consolidate APK hashes, JVM results and both emulator evidence sets before publication. |
| `verification/local_gate.py` | Build the signed release/test APKs and run the emulator gate in an already configured repair environment. |
| `verification/repair.py` | Bound local repair/retest attempts and retain failures; stop changes to protected acceptance infrastructure. |

Use each argparse-based helper's `--help` for its exact arguments. Read the
verification guide before invoking the Android controller or local repair gate:
a full Android run clears app data and requires a disposable emulator. Local
repair needs its documented signing and attempt environment; `dev.py check`
does not supply these prerequisites or replace any release gate.

## Targeted investigations

`check_asr_onset.py` and `scripts/d2-replay/` support targeted speech diagnostics.
The replay experiments, inputs and coverage limitations are described in
[d2-replay/README.md](d2-replay/README.md). They are investigation tools with
separate model/audio prerequisites, rather than substitutes for the release
acceptance suite.

For a change, choose the smallest relevant checks first, retain their failure
evidence, then run the required exact-revision release gates. Introductions to
the code and dependency boundaries live in
[docs/architecture/README.md](../docs/architecture/README.md).
