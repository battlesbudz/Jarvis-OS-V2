# Repository collaboration rules

- Never create a new pull request without Justin Battles's explicit permission. A request to implement a feature or fix is not permission to open a new PR.
- Commits may be pushed to an existing open PR without asking again when they are part of the requested work.
- Continue the current audio work on `audio-pr2`, under existing PR #6. Do not create a separate PR for additions to that work.
- Do not merge a pull request without explicit permission.
- PR #7 is closed without merging and reserved for a future feature. Its head branch `feature/gemma-model-switch` was deleted by Justin on 2026-10-03; nothing left to preserve. Repurpose/reopen #7 only when Justin requests the next feature's PR.

## Development verification

- For Jarvis feature work and release candidates, read `.agents/skills/jarvis-verify/SKILL.md` and follow `docs/verification/README.md`. Maintain the acceptance map in `docs/verification/features.md`.
- Run applicable release JVM/native checks and the Android sandbox for the exact changed revision before calling an APK verified. Retain failed-run evidence and fix/retest within the bounded repair policy.
- Label missing real-model, physical audio and device-performance coverage explicitly. A passing emulator suite is a release candidate for Justin's final signoff.

## Maintainability

- Start with `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/architecture/README.md` and `scripts/README.md` to locate the owner of a change. Current source/workflows are authoritative; dated plans and old test counts are historical.
- Keep `MainActivity` responsible for Android entry points and lifecycle, and `JarvisRuntime` responsible for composition/session orchestration. Put setup, durable tasks, memory fencing, turn delivery and native speech operations in their named collaborators.
- Give collaborators explicit dependencies and an identifiable resource/state owner. Do not split a large file into extensions that require unrestricted access to the entire runtime, or add a generic service container for unrelated responsibilities.
- Preserve dispatcher, cancellation, model/microphone lease, memory-delivery and durable-action contracts when extracting code. Storage keys, native callbacks, Android component names and release instrumentation interfaces are compatibility boundaries.
- Update the architecture map when introducing a new responsibility. Prefer an existing cohesive component over another abstraction; introduce Gradle library modules only when their dependencies and independent verification justify them.
