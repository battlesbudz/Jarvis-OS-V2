# Development setup and release handoff

Run commands from the repository root. The hosted workflow is the complete
reference gate; local checks are useful when the required tools/devices exist.
Read [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) before automated work and
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) before changing ownership.

## Restore a checkout

Clone/fetch `battlesbudz/Jarvis-OS-V2` through your authorized GitHub access and
check out the agreed branch. Current audio integration uses `audio-pr2`, existing
PR #6. Use a separate worktree and explicit file scope for concurrent development.
A PR CI run tests GitHub's merge candidate; its receipt separately identifies the
branch head. Keep both identities when reviewing a candidate.

```bash
git status --short --branch
python3 scripts/dev.py map
python3 scripts/dev.py doctor
```

The doctor is read-only and reports missing tools. Its successful exit does not
mean an Android build environment is available. Generated `app/build`, Gradle/CMake
state and model weights are not source files and can be rebuilt/redownloaded.
Do not copy private app data or signing material into a checkout.

## Toolchain

| Requirement | Version/notes |
| --- | --- |
| Host JDK | 21, matching CI; LiteRT-LM 0.16.0 host classes require it |
| Gradle | Installed Gradle 8.10.2; this tree has no Gradle wrapper |
| Android SDK | Platform 35, build tools, platform-tools/adb; set `ANDROID_HOME` or local `sdk.dir` |
| Android NDK | `27.2.12479018` |
| CMake | `3.22.1`; also a host C/C++ compiler for native keyword checks |
| Python | 3.10+ for SDK preparation/build/check controllers |
| Emulator for full Android gate | Disposable API 30/35 Google APIs device able to execute `arm64-v8a`; hosted Linux runner provides KVM |
| Network/disk | Dependency/model archive hosts must be reachable; native dependencies and several-GB phone models need free space |

Application Java/Kotlin bytecode targets Java 17; this does not lower the host JDK
requirement. AGP/Kotlin/R8 pins are in the root Gradle files. `gradle.properties`
bounds build workers and gives Kotlin its own heap; use the build performance
artifact to diagnose slow tasks before changing those limits.

On a prepared SDK, install the pinned components with `sdkmanager`:

```bash
sdkmanager 'platforms;android-35' 'build-tools;35.0.0' 'platform-tools' 'ndk;27.2.12479018' 'cmake;3.22.1'
gradle --version
```

Android Studio can import the root Gradle project. Keep `local.properties` local.
The first build prepares the pinned Moonshine/Sherpa SDKs and compiles native
speech/keyword code; subsequent builds reuse generated state and dependency caches.

## Checks

Start with the checks that correspond to the changed behavior:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev.py check
gradle testReleaseUnitTest
```

`dev.py check` runs the SDK-free architecture dependency guard and both Python
helper/harness suites, including nested verification artifact tests. The guard
checks concrete process/activity composition and storage-admission dependencies;
it is not a complete Kotlin parser or package-graph proof. This command does not
run JVM, native or Android tests. A targeted JVM
regression can use `gradle testReleaseUnitTest --tests '<fully qualified test class>'`;
the release gate still requires the complete JVM suite.

The host keyword gate mirrors CI:

```bash
cmake -S app/src/main/cpp/microwakeword -B /tmp/jarvis-keyword-native -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build /tmp/jarvis-keyword-native --parallel 2
python3 scripts/check_keyword_models.py /tmp/jarvis-keyword-native/microwakeword_test
```

For a development APK, `gradle assembleDebug` uses Android's debug key and the
same ARM64 native requirements. A debug-signed build cannot update the permanently
signed release installation. Use a disposable device/profile for development.

## Signed release build

Release signing needs an existing keystore and these environment variables:
`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, and
`ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`. CI restores the same permanent key from
`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` plus the password/alias secrets. Never commit the key,
print passwords, or generate a replacement key to bypass an update failure.

CI sets `ANDROID_VERSION_CODE`, `ANDROID_VERSION_NAME`, and `GITHUB_SHA` to bind
version/source identity to the run. Local defaults are version code 1, version
name `0.1.0`, and source `unavailable`; a locally built APK is not an exact CI
candidate merely because its filename matches.

With the signing environment configured:

```bash
bash scripts/ci_gradle.sh local-release testReleaseUnitTest assembleRelease assembleReleaseAndroidTest
```

Outputs are `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` and
`app/build/outputs/apk/androidTest/release/app-release-androidTest.apk`. Preserve the
normal APK before rebuilding with `-PcompactApk=true`: both use the same output
path. CI stages `artifact/app-release.apk` and `artifact/app-compact.apk`, checks
parity and signs both. Compact packaging reduces the sideload download; Android
extracts its native libraries at install time. See [APK size audit](../apk-size-audit.md).

Run the complete disposable-emulator gate using the
[verification runbook](../verification/README.md). Its full run clears Jarvis data
and must not be pointed at a personal phone. Interactive snapshots are separate
from the destructive full-run fixture. The local repair gate runs one device;
hosted release acceptance includes both API 30 normal and API 35 compact variants.

## Native and release boundaries

`app/build.gradle.kts` wires SDK extraction and Sherpa's native build into
`preBuild`. `scripts/prepare_moonshine_sdk.py` namespaces Moonshine's ONNX runtime;
Sherpa/Piper/Whisper/Silero retain their matching runtime. A packaging `pickFirst`
for competing ONNX libraries would break versioned native symbols.

`voice/SherpaPcmCallback.java` is the concrete native PCM callback ABI.
`scripts/sherpa_jni_profile.py` limits compiled Sherpa sources/symbols.
`app/proguard-rules.pro` preserves native lookups and contracts used by the
separately shrunk release-test APK. Keep these synchronized when moving or renaming
an ABI owner; debug compilation cannot verify this boundary.

CI runs ASR packaging, Piper callback/retired-asset, signing and normal/compact
parity checks. [scripts/README.md](../../scripts/README.md) describes their commands.
Native caches contain generated products only; a cache hit never replaces the
current revision's tests or evidence receipt.

## Install and hand off

Use the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/battlesbudz/Jarvis-OS-V2/releases)
for the published standard or compact APK. Both have the same application ID and
permanent signature. A higher version code and matching key allow an in-place
update that preserves private app data; uninstall/clear-data removes models,
conversations and device-local memory. The manifest disables Android backup.

After installation, choose a catalog model, download or import its supported
`.litertlm` bundle, prepare the selected ASR/Piper assets, and use the setup smoke
check. Model integrity/readiness and inference smoke acceptance are distinct.
Phone validation then checks actual recognition, call lifetime, interruption,
context, action receipts and latency; use [voice acceptance](../verification/voice-audio-and-metrics.md).

A release handoff states the source/branch-head identity, numbered GitHub Release,
normal/compact APK hashes, JVM/native gate, both sandbox outcomes, receipt, and
remaining device/model gaps. Evidence artifacts expire after 14 days, so retain
relevant failures/measurements when investigating long-lived problems. No count of
historical passing builds establishes that the current candidate passed.

## Common blockers

| Symptom | Check first |
| --- | --- |
| `UnsupportedClassVersionError` in host tests | JDK 21 is active for Gradle, not only the shell |
| SDK/NDK/CMake missing | Doctor output and the pinned versions above |
| Cold native/dependency build stalls | Network access and native task logs; do not remove required checks |
| Release runner fails before tests | Shared R8/class-loader ABI and callback/package keep rules |
| Emulator cannot install/run shipping APK | ARM64 runtime support, Google APIs image and available KVM |
| APK update rejected | Signature and version code; preserve data while diagnosing |
| Build passes but publication is blocked | Both sandbox jobs and exact-build receipt for this same run/attempt |
