# Cross-version journal fixtures

These synthetic fixtures were serialized by the unchanged original Kotlin writers
and decoded by the unchanged Muse build-1067 reader, not handwritten to match the
compatibility implementation. No user/device data is included.

The full Muse fixtures contain media actions supported by the integrated common
codec. All six fixtures must survive migration and compatible writes. The
native-compatible variants retain phone
permissions, denied/revoked other-source records, approvals, grants and receipts.
The schema-3 positive fixture also retains a genuine workflow, waiting occurrence,
completed-step IDs, step results, resume time/path and workflow receipts. Native
compatibility does not imply that this branch runs those workflows.
