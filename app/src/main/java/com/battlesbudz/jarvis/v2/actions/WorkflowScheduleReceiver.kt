/**
 * M2 schedule receiver (D27/D63, T13).
 *
 * - Alarm fire: claims the occurrence atomically (SCHEDULED→RUNNING) and
 *   hands it to the runtime. A redelivered alarm finds the occurrence
 *   already claimed and does nothing — triggers never double-fire.
 * - Reboot: recovers the journal (interrupted runs are marked failed, never
 *   re-fired) and re-arms future occurrences from the ledger.
 * - Timezone/clock change: recomputes future occurrences from their trigger
 *   slots in the new zone instead of shifting wall-clock intent.
 *
 * Missed-run evaluation needs the local planner's circumstances, so
 * past-due occurrences are left for [JarvisRuntime.evaluateMissedWorkflowRuns]
 * when the app runs — the receiver never auto-runs a stale occurrence and
 * never creates a catch-up duplicate storm.
