/**
 * One video service instance's right to update its notification. Android may
 * remove its foreground association before delivering onDestroy; an update in
 * that interval can leave an ordinary notification behind. Remove both the
 * foreground association and that exact notification ID, in that order.
 *
 * Revoke publication before camera cleanup (which can synchronously report a
 * detach failure). Serialize the actual post with revocation, including posts
 * from camera callbacks outside the service coroutine scope. Cleanup runs
 * outside this lock: never hold a notification lock while waiting for a camera
 * callback. A closed instance never regains publication rights.
