 * M1c screen control: compact observation, verified targets, session-scoped

 *
 * This file is JVM-pure (no android.* imports) so the whole state machine is
 * unit-testable. The Android half ([ScreenControlService]) implements
 * [ScreenBridge] against the accessibility APIs.
 *
 * Verified-target rule: every screen mutation (tap/scroll/type) must name a
 * target ID and observation token from the latest [ScreenObservation]. A token
 * rotates on every observation, so anything observed before the current screen
 * state is stale and can never dispatch. The approval additionally binds to
 * the observed content generation ([ScreenObservation.contentFingerprint]):
 * dispatch re-reads the live generation and fails closed when the window's
 * content changed since the observation, even if the target kept its
 * resource ID, walk position, role, label and bounds.
