/**
 * Finding 1 production routine-dispatch seam: routine-grant admission
 * followed by [JournaledActionPipeline.executeAttempt]. Extracted from
 * WorkflowCoordinator.dispatchWorkflowStep so the regression test drives
 * the real production path instead of a hand-rolled approximation
 * (manual claim + pipeline.execute), which would pass even if the
 * production pre-claim were reintroduced.
 *
 * Claim discipline: executeAttempt owns the claim — it claims the admitted
 * attempt atomically (eligibility, provider, schema, exact approval). An
 * extra claim inserted before executeAttempt leaves the attempt RUNNING, so
 * executeAttempt's claim — which only accepts
 * QUEUED/READY/WAITING_APPROVAL — rejects, the step never executes, and the
 * reminder never posts. The regression test fails in that state.
