/**
 * Pure state machine orchestrating video capture for a call. Android-free:
 * the [VideoBinder] does the platform work (CameraX), so this is fully
 * unit-testable.
 *
 * Capture is owned by exactly one call identity: [start] records the call
 * that owns the capture, and only [stopForCall] with that same identity (or
 * [stop]) ends it. A stale farewell for an ended call can never stop a
 * newer call's capture, and capture never survives into passive wake
 * listening — the runtime ends it with the call that owned it.
 *
 * States: IDLE -> ACTIVE -> IDLE, IDLE -> DENIED -> IDLE,
 * ACTIVE -> DEGRADED -> IDLE, or * -> CLEANUP_PENDING -> IDLE / ACTIVE.
 * DENIED means the camera permission was refused: the binder is never
 * touched and the service degrades to audio-only. DEGRADED means the
 * permission was granted but the camera itself failed (provider failure,
 * no back camera, bind failure): the binder is released and the call
 * continues audio-only. The owning call identity is retained through
 * DEGRADED so ending the call still cleans up exactly once.
 * CLEANUP_PENDING means a bind was refused or a teardown's detach failed:
 * the binder still owns the previous capture's camera handle because the
 * detach was never confirmed, so a fresh capture cannot start on top of it.
 * The refusal is explicit ([VideoBinder.bind] returns [BindResult]) and the
 * pending state stays visible in the controller and the service status —
 * a failed detach followed by the next call can never advertise video the
 * binder deliberately did not start. A new start retries the retained
 * detach first; only a confirmed cleanup re-arms capture.
