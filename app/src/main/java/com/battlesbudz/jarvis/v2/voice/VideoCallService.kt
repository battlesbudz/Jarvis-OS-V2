/**
 * Companion to [VoiceCallService]: holds the camera foreground-service type
 * and runs the frame-capture pipeline while a call is active.
 *
 * Audio stays entirely in VoiceCallService — this service never touches the
 * microphone, TTS, or audio routing. Lifecycle: capture starts per call via
 * [startCapture] (the call's identity owns the capture) and ends when that
 * call ends, by its own Stop action, by [onTaskRemoved], or automatically
 * when the voice session ends (it observes VoiceCallService.stopRequested
 * as a fail-safe). Capture never runs for a merely-armed wake session: a
 * spoken farewell ends the call's capture while wake listening stays armed.
 *
 * If the camera permission is denied, the service still runs (so Stop works)
 * but never binds the camera: the call degrades to audio-only.
